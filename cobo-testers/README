To build the COBO testers, do make on each of the three subdirectories:
cobo-cmb, cobo-orig and mp_cobo_driver.

cobo-orig and mp_cobo_driver are the subdirectories in which vanilla
and CMB COBO testers reside, respectively. Please follow the README 
files in these subdirectories to run these testers. 

cobo-cmb has the COBO source tree ported to CMB KVS operations, and
mp_cobo_driver requires this. So make cobo-cmb first before building
the testers.
