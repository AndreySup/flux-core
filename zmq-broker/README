| Launching the framework |
+-------------------------+

Use the ./launch script to start the framework in a slurm job.
It will work with or without a pre-existing slurm allocation.
If running outside of an allocation, specify the number of nodes (N)
with "./launch -n N".

There are pepe config files for several test topologies.  By default,
./launch uses "flat", but you can select a different config with
"./launch -c NAME":

binary
	Binary (k=2) tree with no resiliency.

binomial
	Binomial tree with no resilency.

degenerate
	Degenerate (k=1) tree with no resilency.

flat
	Flat (k=N) tree with no resilency.

trinary
	Trinary (k=3) tree with resiliency.
	(Each node except 0 and 1 have a backup parent == their grandparent).

| The Event Overlay Plane |
+-------------------------+

There are two orthogonal overlay planes: one for events, and one for
requests.  Events utilize pub-sub with hiericical topic names.
One (un)subscribes to a topic by substring.  For example, subscribing
to "event.sched." matches "event.sched.trigger.<epoch>".  A this point,
events consist only of one frame containing the topic name.  The events
that are currently exchange consist of:

event.sched.trigger.<epoch>
event.live.up.<node>
event.live.down.<node>
event.route.update
event.barrier.exit.<name>

+---------------------------+
| The Request Overlay Plane |
+---------------------------+

Requests are messages that may or may not elicit response messages.
A request is sent to a service name, which looks just like a subscription
topic.  If the service name matches as a substring of the service in the
request, the plugin implementing the service receives the request.
For example a request sent to "kvs.put" or "kvs.get"  is matched by the
"kvs" plugin.

Requests build a source-address route as they traverse the overlay tree,
accumulating address frames as they travel through each hop.  This source-
address route is used to get any response(s) back to the sender.
