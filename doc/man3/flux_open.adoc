NAME
----
flux_open, flux_close - open/close connection to Flux Message Broker


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

flux_t flux_open (const char *uri, int flags);

void flux_close (flux_t h);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_open()` creates a `flux_t` handle, used to communicate with the
Flux message broker.

The _uri_ scheme (before "://") specifies the "connector"
that will be used to establish the connection.  The _uri_ path
(after "://") is parsed by the connector.  If _uri_ is NULL,
the "local" connector will be used, with path taken from the $FLUX_TMPDIR
environment variable.

_flags_ is the logical "or" of zero or more of the following flags:

FLUX_O_TRACE::
Dumps message trace to stderr.

FLUX_O_COPROC::
Reactor message callbacks should be started as coprocesses.

FLUX_O_NONBLOCK::
The `flux_send()` and `flux_recv()` functions should never block.

`flux_close()` destroys a `flux_t` handle, closing its connection with
the Flux message broker.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_open()` returns an open `flux_t` handle on success.  On error,
NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.


EXAMPLES
--------

This example opens the Flux broker using the default connector
and path, requests the broker rank, and finally closes the broker handle.
