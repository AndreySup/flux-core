NAME
----
flux_fd_watcher_create, flux_fd_watcher_get_fd -  create file descriptor watcher


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 typedef void (*flux_watcher_f)(flux_reactor_t *r,
                                flux_watcher_t *w,
                                int revents, void *arg);

 flux_watcher_t *flux_fd_watcher_create (flux_reactor_t *r,
                                         int fd, int events,
                                         flux_watcher_f callback,
                                         void *arg);

 int flux_fd_watcher_get_fd (flux_watcher_t *w);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_fd_watcher_create()` creates a flux_watcher_t object which can be used
to monitor for events on a file descriptor _fd_.  When events occur,
the user-supplied _callback_ is invoked.

The _events_ and _revents_ arguments are a bitmask containing a logical
``or'' of the following bits.  If a bit is set in _events_, it indicates
interest in this type of event.  If a bit is set in _revents_, it
indicates that this event has occurred.

FLUX_POLLIN::
The file descriptor is ready for reading.

FLUX_POLLOUT::
The file descriptor is ready for writing.

FLUX_POLLERR::
The file descriptor has encountered an error.
This bit is ignored if it is set in the create _events_ argument.

Events are processed in a level-triggered manner.  That is, the callback
will continue to be invoked as long as the event has not been
fully consumed or cleared, and the watcher has not been stopped.

`flux_fd_watcher_get_fd()` is used to obtain the file descriptor from
within the flux_watcher_f callback.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_fd_watcher_create()` returns a flux_watcher_t object on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_fd_watcher_get_fd()` returns the file descriptor associated with
the watcher.


ERRORS
------

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
