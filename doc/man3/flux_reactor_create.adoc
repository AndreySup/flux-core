NAME
----
flux_reactor_create, flux_reactor_destroy, flux_reactor_run, flux_reactor_stop, flux_reactor_stop_error - create/destroy/control event reactor object


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

flux_reactor_t *flux_reactor_create (void);

void flux_reactor_destroy (flux_reactor_t *r);

int flux_reactor_run (flux_reactor_t *r, int flags);

void flux_reactor_stop (flux_reactor_t *r);

void flux_reactor_stop_error (flux_reactor_t *r);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_reactor_create()` creates a flux_reactor_t object which can be used
to monitor for events on file descriptors, ZeroMQ sockets, timers, and
flux_t broker handles.

For each event source and type that is to be monitored, a flux_watcher_t
object is created using a type-specific create function, and started
with flux_watcher_start(3).  To receive events, control must be
transferred to the reactor event loop by calling `flux_reactor_run()`,
which processes events until one of the following conditions is met:

* There are no more active watchers.
* The `flux_reactor_stop()` or `flux_reactor_stop_error()` functions
  are called by one of the watchers.
* Flags include FLUX_REACTOR_NOWAIT and all outstanding events have
  been consumed
* Flags include FLUX_REACTOR_ONCE, at least one event has occurred,
  and all outstanding events have been consumed.

If `flux_reactor_stop_error()` is called, this will cause
`flux_reactor_run()` to return -1 indicating that an error has occurred.
The caller should ensure that a valid error code has been assigned to
errno(3) before calling this function.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_reactor_create()` returns a flux_reactor_t object on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_reactor_run()` returns zero on normal termination.
On failure, or on termination by `flux_reactor_stop_error()`, -1 is returned
with errno set.


ERRORS
------

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
