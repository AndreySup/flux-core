NAME
----
flux_msg_encode, flux_msg_decode - convert a Flux message to buffer and back again


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

int flux_msg_encode (const flux_msg_t *msg, void **buf, size_t *size);

flux_msg_t *flux_msg_decode (void *buf, size_t size);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_msg_encode()` converts _msg_ to a serialized representation,
allocated internally and assigned to _buf_, number of bytes to _size_.
The caller must release _buf_ with free(3).

`flux_msg_decode()` performs the inverse, creating _msg_ from _buf_ and _size_.
The caller must destroy _msg_ with flux_msg_destroy().

RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_msg_encode()` returns 0 on success.  On error, -1 is returned,
and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_msg_decode()` the decoded message on success.  On error, NULL
is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
