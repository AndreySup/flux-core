FLUX-EXEC(1)
============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-exec - Execute processes across flux ranks


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *exec* ['--dir=DIR'] ['--rank=RANKS'] ['--verbose'] COMMANDS...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-exec(1) runs commands across one or more cmb ranks using the 'cmb.exec'
service. The commands are direct children of cmbd, and stdio is thus folded
into the stdout and stderr of cmbd.

flux-exec(1) is meant as an administrative and test utility, and should not
be used for executing lightweight jobs (LWJs) or user commands.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
In the case that all processes are successfully launched, the exit status
of flux-exec(1) is the largest of the remote process exit codes.

If a non-existent rank is targeted, flux-exec(1) will return with
code 68 (EX_NOHOST from sysexits.h).

OPTIONS
-------

*-d, --dir*'=DIR'::
Set the working directory of remote 'COMMANDS' to 'DIR'. The default is to
propagate the current working directory of flux-exec(1).

*-r, --rank*'=RANKS'::
Target specific ranks in 'RANKS'. Default is to target all ranks.

*-v, --verbose*::
Run with more verbosity.
