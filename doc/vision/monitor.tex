\section{File System Provisioning and System Monitoring}

This section describes the system provisioning and system monitoring
subsystems of \ngrm.  By coupling these systems to the resource manager,
we achieve our goals of mitigating system noise, improving job launch time,
and promoting reproduceability and data provenance.

\subsection{File System Provisioning}

We use the term "file system provisioning" to describe how executables
and other read-only data are provided to compute nodes.
A provisioning system based on immutable datasets is proposed.
Immutable datasets are collections of files that can be aggressively cached
without revalidation,
and accurately referenced in a job record for data provenance.
In the proposed system, a dataset is stored in a container,
actually itself a file formatted as a local file system such as ext4 or
squashfs.  The container, which is stored in a special dataset repository,
is exported as a read-only network block device,
then mounted as a read-only, local file system on compute nodes,
where the files that comprise the dataset are individually accessible.
The system can be used to provision the root file system,
or any other file system provided its content can be stored immutably
in a dataset container and managed in the dataset repository.

The provisioning system consists of the
distributed network block device,
dataset repository,
tools for creating and managing datasets,
and the resource manager interfaces for assigning datasets to jobs
such that they become part of a job's runtime environment and
are referenced in the job's historical record.


\subsubsection{Distributed Network Block Device}

A network block device driver based on 9P protocol called 9nbd\cite{9nbd}
was prototyped in August 2012.
9nbd, which at a high level has functionality similar to iSCSI or SRP,
leverages the existing kernel 9P transport to access a backing file
in a remote 9P file system.
A hierarcically distributed, shared network block device can be built
using 9nbd and any number of levels of chained 9P diod\cite{diod}
I/O forwarding servers, fanned out in a hierarchy as depicted in
Figure~\ref{Fig9nbd}.

\paragraph{Performance Outlook}
A diod I/O forwarding server will read the working set of the container
file in once and thereafter serve it from its page cache to multiple clients.
At each compute node,
the block device driver naturally caches its working set in the buffer cache,
which is optimized for many common file system usage patterns,
such as path search and dynamic library loading.
A study of parallel path search\cite{BlkDevPathSearch}
using ext4, the {\em loopback} block device, one level of diod I/O forwarding
with a fanout of 82 to 1, and a single NFS server,
showed flat scaling to 82 nodes, the largest scale attempted,
while NFS began to slow at eight nodes.
This result, depicted in Figure~\ref{FigPathWalk},
indicates that the distributed block device based on 9P has
great promise to improve job launch times over NFS, and the flexible
hierarchical architecture should easily scale to 100K nodes, although
testing with more than one level of diod forwarding may identify some
additional work required to get there.
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{../fig/pathwalk.eps}
\caption{\small
Path walk performance for distributed block device based on 9P and diod
scales the same as the null slurm job up to 82 nodes, while NFS begins
to slow at 8 nodes.
}
\label{FigPathWalk}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{System Noise Outlook}
The distributed block device requires no cache management as the
data is read-only throughout the system.  Unlike NFS (even mounted read-only),
compute nodes will not attempt to asynchronously revalidate cached
attributes or data, since the entire dataset is immutable.
Data in the buffer cache is never dirty, and can be thrown out and at
any point should the application require the memory, and reread on demand later.
Therefore, the approach is very friendly to applications running on compute
nodes, with a system noise footprint that can be near zero.

\paragraph{Security}
The 9nbd prototype and diod server implement MUNGE authentication
over the built-in TCP transport plugin, and no integrity or privacy.
The \ngrm\ comms framework security model should be leveraged,
by adding an \ngrm-specific kernel 9P transport plugin,
to obtain integrity and privacy for I/O forwarding within a comms session,

\paragraph{Resiliency}
The 9nbd prototype implements single server resiliency, where the
9nbd block device driver can re-establish the transport and replay
9P connection state to a new server instance should the server reboot.
The client blocks while this recovery takes place.
The \ngrm\ comms framework CMB should be leveraged,
by adding an \ngrm-specific kernel 9P transport plugin,
to obtain multi-server resiliency based on storing possible diod server
identities in the CMB state and tracking liveness changes.
The client can thus recover more quickly by leveraging the CMB.

\paragraph{Root File System Special Needs}
Provisioning the system root file system to diskless nodes requires
some additional care and is somewhat distribution specific.
Root has to be mounted from a limited initramfs environment, which
implies that MUNGE and 9nbd have to be functional in that environment.
For distributions based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, a {\em dracut}
module is needed for both MUNGE and 9nbd.  Once root is mounted, it can
remain read-only, or more conveniently, it can be combined with a {\em zram}
memory-based block device using {\em dm-snapshot}, making it appear
writable, with any changes going to RAM.  The dracut modules and the
dm-snapshot/zram support can be added to the nfsroot\cite{nfsroot}
software package.

\subsubsection{Dataset Repository}

Dataset containers can initially be stored in NFS, Lustre, or a local file
system and managed by system administrators using simple scripts.
However, there are a few practical problems with this.
One is that a large number of nearly identical containers may proliferate
and use too much space.  Another is that there is no mechanism to take a
reference on a dataset such that the reference is guaranteed to refer to
the same content forever.
Finally, the intent is to allow users to manage the content of their datasets,
but user access must be controlled such that containers are always
valid file system images and container metadata is properly filled in.
These three factors motivate the need for a specialized dataset repository.

\paragraph{Copy-on-write}
A large number of nearly identical containers may proliferate, for example
if a dataset is undergoing iterative changes during development.
Ideally the file system storing dataset containers will support
{\em thin copies} or block level {\em de-duplication} so that only one
copy of unchanged content is stored.

\paragraph{Content Addressable}
To prevent datasets from changing while mounted, which would trigger
kernel panics, and from run to run, which would affect provenance and
reproduceability, the file system storing dataset containers should
be content addressable.  For example, instead of a file name, a cryptographic
hash of its content is used to refer to a container file.
The file system or the repository interface should enforce this atomically.

\paragraph{Container Format and Repository Model}
Containers must contain valid file system images in order to avoid
mount errors or kernel panics, and certain metadata should be associated
with containers to record information about how it was created.
The resource manager will take references on containers when they are used
and when they are referenced by a job's provenance record.
Thus the dataset repository is more than a file system that has
content addressability and copy-on-write.
It must enforce provsioning system policy over container additions and
removals and ensure that it contains only valid containers.

\subsubsection{Tools for Creating and Managing Datasets}

Tools similar to those provided for package management are required to
create valid containers with proper metadata from collections of files,
for managing and updating containers, and for interacting with the repository.
Stakeholders such as system administrators and code teams who might
be interested in creating datasets should be consulted to understand
their workflow and tool needs.  

\subsubsection{Resource Manager Interface}

The provisioning system is intended to be used in conjunction with
the \ngrm\ runtime's capability of configuring the file system
namespace (e.g. set of mount points) on a custom basis for each job. 

FIXME: launching a custom I/O forwarding topology within the job.

FIXME: taking a reference on a container while it is mounted and
from job log for provenance.
