\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{staging} plugins for stage-in, stage-out that could work
for Spindle, diod, or something more simple minded that other sites might use.
For provenance, checksums and paths of all files recorded plus container info.}
\item{\textbf{namespace} plugins for startup of I/O forwarding servers,
mounting on demand, inserting things like plfs, creating file systems on
allocated disks, etc.}
\item{plugins for monitoring and recording file accesses as in "provenance
  aware condor" paper}
\item{plugins for establishing network channels with QoS for access to file
systems}
\item{sharing fault information between apps and file system clusters
  (not sure if that belongs here but maybe)}
