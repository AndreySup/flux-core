NAME
----
flux-logger - create a Flux log entry 


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *logger* ['--severity SEVERITY'] ['--appname NAME'] 'message' '...'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-logger(1) creates Flux log entries.  Log entries are sent to
the local Flux communications broker, then forwarded to the
root of the overlay network, where they are disposed of according
to the logging configuration of the communications session.

Log entries are associated with a syslog(3) style severity.
Valid severity names are 'emerg', 'alert', 'crit', 'err',
'warning', 'notice', 'info', 'debug'.

Log entries may also have an application name (default 'logger').

Log entries are timestamped with the wall clock time, as
reported by gettimeofday(2) at the point of origin, and with
the rank of the communications broker originating the message.


OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --severity*='SEVERITY'::
Specify the log message severity.  The default severity is 'info'.

*-n, --appname*='NAME'::
Specify an application name to associate with the log message.
The default appname is 'logger'.
