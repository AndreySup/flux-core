FLUX-START(1)
=============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-start - bootstrap a local Flux instance


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *start* ['OPTIONS'] [initial-program [args...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-start(1) launches a Flux instance by starting
Flux message brokers local, as children of flux-start(1).
The brokers use UNIX domain sockets to communicate.

Note: in order to launch a Flux instance, you must have generated
long-term CURVE keys using *flux-keygen*.

OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --size*='N'::
Set the size of the comms session (number of message brokers).
The default is 1.

*-o, --broker-opts*='option_string'::
Add options to the message broker daemon, separated by commas.
For example, to set the branching factor of the tree-based-overlay
network to 8 and enable verbose mode:

  flux start -o"-v,--k-ary=8"

*-v, --verbose*::
Display commands before executing them.

*-X, --noexec*::
Don't execute anything.  This option is most useful with -v.
