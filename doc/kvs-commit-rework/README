    kvs: change algorithm used to commit on master
    
    The previous algorithm read the entire namespace into a "by value"
    JSON structure, applied changes, then wrote it all out again.
    
    The new one only reads in those portions of the namespace affected
    by the changes in a commit.  Performance should not degrade as the
    KVS accumulates metadata.
